#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) We have a single loop that appears would only run 2 times, so the runtime complexity would be O(n).


b) The outer loop will run n times for a complexity O(n) and the inner loop will run less than n times `j *= 2` for a complexity of O(log n). O(n*log(n))


c)

## Exercise II
